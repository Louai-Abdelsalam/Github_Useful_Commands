NOTE: these commands must be made only inside the github REPO folder.


# git clone [clone URL] // downloads the repo on your local system.

# git status //shows difference between our copy of the repo and the one saved on the server.

# git add [file name plus extension] //adds file to the repo. if you put -A instead of the file name, 
it will add all files. git add [.] without the brackets will add all files in directory and their content.

# git commit -m "[message]" //commits the file as in locks it in, but it's still on your pc not on 
github server. -n is optional and means attach following message/comment to it.

# git push //pushes whatever is committed into github servers so it becomes online.

# git pull //pulls the files from the servers on github onto the local machine.

#esc:wq // to get out of an unending commit command.
